  <p class="lead">Wearing the uniform for the first time, I felt both nervous and proud. This is an experience I will never forget...</p>

  <h2>5:00 - Woken by the bugle</h2>
  <p>The assembly bugle sounded at 5:00 AM sharp, waking all of us. I quickly put on my uniform—the fresh olive-green outfit felt strange but solemn. The jacket had small details I had not noticed before: brass buttons, tool pockets, and the People's Army insignia.</p>
    <p>Outside the camp, morning mist still clung to the grass. Our roommates were ready—nervous but determined. "This will be the most memorable day for us," Minh said to me as we walked to the training ground.</p>

    <h2>6:00 - Morning flag ceremony</h2>
    <p>We lined up neatly on the lawn. The military instructor—a young officer with a friendly smile—began the flag ceremony. When the national anthem played, I felt an indescribable emotion: not just national pride, but a sense of responsibility as a citizen.</p>

    <p>"Today you're not only students, you're young soldiers," the instructor said. "Learn from those who came before you, and remember that defending the homeland is the sacred duty of every citizen."</p>

    <h2>8:00 - Basic skills training</h2>
    <p>The first training session focused on basic skills: formation, marching in step, and salute drills. I realized every movement had its own meaning. Formation was not just about order; it built team spirit. Each step required precision and discipline.</p>

    <p>An Hung—a young soldier—showed us how to handle the training rifle. "A rifle is not for killing," he explained, "it is to protect peace. When you hold a weapon, you have the responsibility to defend the country."</p>

    <h2>14:00 - Volunteer activities</h2>
    <p>In the afternoon we joined a volunteer clean-up around the camp area. This was the part I enjoyed most. We didn't only learn how to use military equipment; we also learned how to serve the community.</p>

    <p>The elderly woman living near the camp was very happy to see us helping. "You're such good children," she said. "In the past, soldiers also helped villagers like this."</p>

    <h2>18:00 - End of the first day</h2>
  <p>At the end of the day, we sat in a circle to share our impressions. Everyone had unique experiences, but all agreed: this was a meaningful and memorable day.</p>

    <p>"I understand that being a soldier isn't only about wearing a uniform and handling weapons," I shared. "It's also about responsibility, discipline, and love for our homeland."</p>
