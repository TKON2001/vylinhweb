  <p class="lead">Participating in the fire rescue drill taught me how to stay calm in emergencies and deepened my understanding of community service.</p>

  <h2>Preparing for an intense day</h2>
  <p>That morning, we were informed that we would take part in a fire rescue drill with the city fire department. I was excited and anxious—this was my first real experience with fire and smoke.</p>

  <p>We were given protective gear: fire-resistant jackets, helmets, gloves, and gas masks. Mr. Minh—a firefighter with 8 years of experience—explained, "This equipment not only protects you from fire, but also helps you understand the real dangers of our job."</p>

  <h2>Theory before practice</h2>
  <p>Before entering the drill area, we learned about common causes of fires and prevention methods. "Fires don't happen by themselves," Mr. Minh emphasized. "Most fires are caused by human carelessness."</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Never leave electrical equipment running unattended</li>
  <li>Always have a fire extinguisher at home and know how to use it</li>
  <li>In case of fire, priority #1 is evacuation—do not attempt to save property</li>
  <li>Call emergency number immediately when a fire is detected</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fire extinguisher practice</h2>
  <p>The first practice was learning to use CO2 and powder fire extinguishers. Mr. Minh taught us the "P-A-S-S" process: Pull the pin, Aim at the fire, Squeeze the handle, and Sweep the nozzle.</p>

  <p>When it was my turn, my hands were shaking. The flames in the metal container weren’t large, but the heat was intense. "Don’t be afraid, stay calm and follow the procedure," Mr. Minh encouraged. After three tries, I finally put out the fire successfully.</p>

  <h2>Emergency scenario drill</h2>
  <p>The hardest part was the scenario where someone was trapped in a burning building. We were divided into teams: rescue, firefighting, and medical.</p>

  <p>I was on the rescue team. We had to wear full protective gear and enter a building filled with thick smoke. In the smoky environment, I understood what it feels like to be disoriented and short of breath. "This is just artificial smoke, but you can imagine a real situation," Mr. Minh said over the radio.</p>

  <p>We found the "victim" (a mannequin) on the second floor. Carrying an unconscious person down the stairs in thick smoke was truly difficult. I learned that in emergencies, teamwork is the key to success.</p>

  <h2>Lessons on responsibility</h2>
  <p>At the end of the drill, we sat together to reflect. Mr. Minh shared, "Our job is not just to put out fires, but to protect lives and property. Every time the alarm rings, we must be ready to risk ourselves to save others."</p>

  <p>I realized that even though it was just a drill, the sense of responsibility and bravery of the firefighters is truly admirable. They not only have professional skills but also compassion and a strong sense of community service.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This drill gave me many valuable lessons. I understand that fire prevention is not only the responsibility of professionals, but also the awareness of every citizen. We must always be vigilant and ready to respond to emergencies.</p>

  <p>"Safety comes first"—that’s a saying I will always remember. I also understand that in life, we need to be compassionate and ready to help others when they are in difficulty.</p>
