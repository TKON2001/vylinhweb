        <p>12th-grade students in Hanoi participated in a comprehensive fire rescue drill organized in collaboration with local fire services. The training event, which took place at the city's main fire station, provided students with hands-on experience in emergency response and fire safety.</p>
        
        <p>During the drill, students learned essential skills including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Proper use of different types of fire extinguishers</li>
          <li>Emergency evacuation procedures and routes</li>
          <li>Basic first aid techniques for fire-related injuries</li>
          <li>Communication protocols during emergencies</li>
          <li>Fire prevention best practices</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Fire Chief Nguyen Van Minh emphasized the importance of youth involvement in fire safety: "These students are not just learning to protect themselves, but also becoming community safety ambassadors. The knowledge they gain today could save lives tomorrow."</p>

        <p>The drill is part of a broader initiative to enhance emergency preparedness in educational institutions across Vietnam. Following the success of this program, similar drills are planned for other schools in the region.</p>
